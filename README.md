# FaceSwapping
This Python application automatically swaps faces between pairs of images using OpenCV and dlib. It implements sophisticated image processing techniques to detect faces, extract facial landmarks, perform Delaunay triangulation, and seamlessly clone the swapped faces to create natural-looking results.
